# Complexity estimate

This is a simple tool for estimating time complexity of a function.
Used libraries (non-standard):
 - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

# What you need to provide to program for correct results

 - An input generator (in a specific format as in given example) for generating inputs for your funtion
 - An actual function

# How to use a tool

 - Usage is pretty straight-forward (help is provided in main.py)
 - After you provided all necessary things (stated in a section above) assign them to particular constants in main.py file (you may want to follow present comments)
 - The output is a matplotlib plot comparing your function with selected 'comparing' function (for estimating a complexity of your function)
